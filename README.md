# About this fork

This is a personal fork of [deminimis/minimalimageviewer](https://github.com/deminimis/minimalimageviewer) whose main change is proper SVG rendering. The upstream app renders SVGs with Direct2D's `DrawSvgDocument`, which supports only a small subset of SVG (no CSS `<style>` blocks, no `<text>`, no filters) and was also given a hardcoded 1000x1000 viewport that cropped larger documents.

Changes in this fork:

* SVGs are rendered by [resvg](https://github.com/linebender/resvg) (statically linked, MPL-2.0), giving full support for CSS-styled files, text elements, and filters. Files are rasterized at high resolution and flow through the normal image pipeline, so zoom, rotate, crop, and copy all work.
* The Direct2D SVG path remains as an automatic fallback, with its viewport now derived from the document's intrinsic size instead of the hardcoded 1000x1000.
* Fixed command-line file paths not loading when quoted with trailing whitespace.
* Build fixes: the WIL NuGet targets file is included, and `third_party/resvg/` carries the prebuilt resvg static library plus header so no Rust toolchain is needed to build. To regenerate it, clone resvg into `third_party/resvg-src` and run `cargo build --release -p resvg-capi` with `RUSTFLAGS=-C target-feature=+crt-static`, then copy `resvg.h` and `target/release/resvg.lib` into `third_party/resvg/`.

License is unchanged (GPL-3.0). resvg is used unmodified under MPL-2.0.
